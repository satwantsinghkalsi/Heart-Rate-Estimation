# Heart-Rate-Estimation
Given a video clip of a person, estimating the heart rate of the person considering the changes in 
the motion of the person
•	Implementation of Eulerian Video Color Magnification on the person’s face followed by 
Independent Component Analysis on the ROI and then for each frame calculating the heart rate 
using Fast Fourier transform.
•	Tools Used: C++, OpenCV, FFT library.
